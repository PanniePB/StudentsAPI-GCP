# Student RESTful API

This project provides a Student RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, tested with Postman.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used to build the server-side of the application.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It is used to create the RESTful endpoints for the Student API.
- **Postman**: A collaboration platform for API development. Postman is used to test the API endpoints by making HTTP requests and verifying the responses.

 ## Next Step:
The next step is to deploy the project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
